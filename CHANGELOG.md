## [1.4.0] - 2021-02-11

- Support for CORS bypass in Flutter web.
- `userId$` is not required anymore. Users can still use that as a way to set up the userId but they can also use the `userId` setter at any time.

## [1.3.1] - 2020-12-20

- Fixes a bug that caused the stored in memory events when in batch mode to be overwriten by the first events sent, thus being lost. To avoid a breaking change, the temporal solution was to move the process that pulls from memory old stored not sent events from the batch timer process, to happen when the user sends events for the first time. The problem this solution brings is that we need the caller to push new events in order to get the old stored events to be pushed. If the first thing don't happen the second won't either. But this is better than the previous scenario of lost events. For further details you can check [this PR](https://github.com/koa-health/mixpanel_analytics/pull/9)
